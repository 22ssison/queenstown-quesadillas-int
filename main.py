tweaks:
- tell them how many items they have in the cart when they click view cart details or sum
- what if the user has nothing int their cart? (change this so that it tells them they have 0 items in the cart)
- in the check out box, capitalise the first letter of the user's name + address + add a maximum phone number

- check each and evefy integer input and do not allow any inputs to be a negative integer/float/etc
